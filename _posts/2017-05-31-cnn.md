Among the diverse deep learning architecture, convolutional neural network (convnets for short) stands out for its revoltionary performance on computer vision and have been extended to many other applications. It is also a very interesting artificial neural network which is inspired by the animal visual cortex and have been sucessfully applied to vision-oreiented tasks.

In this article, I provide a walkthrough on how to construct a convnet for simple computer vision task, how to tune hyper-parameters for convnet and how to visualize the hidden convolution layers. 

## What is convnet?
CNNs are usually applied to image data. Every image is a matrix of pixel values. 
At its most basic, convolutional neural networks can be thought of as a kind of neural network that uses many identical copies of the same neuron. This allows the network to have lots of neurons and express computationally large models while keeping the number of actual parameters – the values describing how neurons behave – that need to be learned fairly small.

we have seen so far. In fact, they inherit all of the functionality of those, and innovate upon it by introducing a new type of layer, namely a convolutional layer, emulating and refining the innovative structures of the neocognitron. Thus any neural network which contains at least one convolutional layer can be regarded as a convnet.
