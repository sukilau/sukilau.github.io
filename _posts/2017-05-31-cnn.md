Among the diverse deep learning architecture, convolutional neural network (convnets for short) stands out for its unprecedented performance on computer vision. It is a very interesting artificial neural network inspired by the animal visual cortex and sucessfully applied to vision recognition tasks. 

In this article, I will provide a walkthrough on how to construct a convnet for a simple image recognition task, how to tune hyper-parameters for convnet and how to visualize the hidden convolutional layers. 


## Image recognition

First things first, what do we want our computer to do?  When we see a cat running in backyard or sleeping on a couch, our minds subconsciously recognize it as a cat. We want our computer to do similar things for us, that is to take an image as input, figure out its unique fetaures and label the image as an output.  This is basically what convnet can do for us. 


## What is convnet?

At its most basic, convnet is a special kind of neural networks which contains at least one convolutional layer. A typical convent structure include a convolutional layer which takes the image, nonlinear activation layer, pooling (downsampling) and fully connected layer to output the classification labels.

A convnet differs from a regular neural network by the use of convolutional layer. In a regular neural network, we use the entire image to train the network. It works well for simple centered image but fails to recognize image with more complex internel variation. Having more hidden layers to learn abstract features would help but it is rather impractical as we need far too many neurons to train and store in memory.

A convnet performs image classification by looking for low level features such as edges, lines and curves, and then building up to more abstract concepts through a series of convolutional layers. 

On the other hand, a convnet recognizes a object at a deeper level by learning a small set of shared filters. A convnet  learns individual parts of an object, stores in individual neurons, and add them up to recognize a larger object. In other words, a convnet somehow learns the content of an image and generalizes better for more complex image recognition. 

More technicallu, A convolutional layer uses many identical copies of the same set of neurons (shared filters) on small regions of image data to build a deeper . The advantage of using shared weights in the convolutional layer helps largely reduce the actual parameter learning.
