Here is the list of 10+ free data science resources I've found very useful in my data science journey!

* [The Elements of Statistical Learning (Book)](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print10.pdf) is a highly-regarded statistics book in machine learning community, but it is a bit hard to read if you have no math or statistics background. It is a very good book to refer to from time to time to have a thorough understanding in statistical learning.

* [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course (MOOC)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is one of the first machine learning MOOCs by Coursera founder and Stanford Professor Andrew Ng. It is a very good starting point for beginner to machine learning as it provides a broad introduction to machine learning topics including supervised learning, unsupervised learning and best practices. The course uses Octave programming language.

* [Data Science (MOOC)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) is a very comprehensive course teaching concepts and tools throughout the entire data science pipeline, from clearning data to pratical machine learning. The course uses R programming language.
 
* [Applied Machine Learning in Python (MOOC)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning) teaches practical machine learning algorithms in Python using sci-kit learn. It is also part of the "Applied Data Science with Python" specialization with other modules teaching social network analysis and text analysis techniques.
 
* [Deep Learning (Book)](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) is a good textbook for learners to enter the field of deep learning. 

* [Neural Networks for Machine Learning (MOOC)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks) teaches basic algorithms and practical tricks to work with neural networks in machine learning. It is suitbale for intermediate learners with experience in Python. 

* [Stanford CS Class on Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (Course Notes)](http://cs231n.github.io/) is a course focus on computer visison and much of the materials are drawn from the ImageNet Challenge. It teaches how to set up the problem of image recognition, learning algorithms, practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning the networks, visualization. I found the course notes particular useful as it provides links to useful academic papers. 


Apart from courses, books and papers, there are many good data science blogs where we could learn tips and tricks and best practices in the industry. Here are some of the blogs I've found fun and easy to read, and also quick to follow from scratch.  

* [Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)
* [Machine Learning Mastery](http://machinelearningmastery.com/)
* [Edwin Chen's Blog](http://blog.echen.me/)
* [Simply Statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/)
* [Kaggle's Blog](http://blog.kaggle.com/)
* [Quora Data Science](https://www.quora.com/topic/Data-Science)

Happy learning!
