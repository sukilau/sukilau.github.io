Here is the list of 10+ free data science resources I've found very useful in my data science journey!

* [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print10.pdf) is a highly-regarded staistics book in machine learning community, but it is a bit hard to read if you have no math or statistics background. It is a very good book to refer to from time to time to consolidate a thorough understanding in statistical learning.
