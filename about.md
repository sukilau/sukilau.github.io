## Hi, I'm Suki.

I like telling stories with data and graphics.  I began my journey into data science few months ago when I dived into  my first Kaggle problem.  Currently, I'm learning deep neural nets and exploring the potentials of data visualization with D3 and Processing, hoping to create things for humans with math, art and code. 

Previously, I was a Government Statistician in Hong Kong and I received both my Bachelors and Masters Degree on Mathematics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
